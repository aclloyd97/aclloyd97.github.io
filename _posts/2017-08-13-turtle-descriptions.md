There are many different kinds of turtles, near the hundreds of thousands of you wish for some err of accuracy. Each turtle has their own thoughts and beliefs, unique features to distinguish it from other animals, and daily patterns to follow. A turtle is typically a social creature, unlike the popular belief suggests. However, they do well on their own too. They are very good at avoiding other turtles when needed, but understand when it is beneficial to be a part of a collective.

To begin, perhaps we should discuss the appearance of a turtle. Surely, you know what the typical homebody looks like. Like a hermit, a turtle can scrunch it self into a shell. However, the turtle has much of his flesh exposed when this happens. The head and face are pushed, the limbs are tucked, but damage can still occur to the being. Unlike the hermit, a turtle is not without its shell. Her protective layer can dissuade predators and friendlies alike, but anything that happens to her shell, she feels as well. This actual shell is known as a carapace. This carapace has multiple parts to it. The plastron covers the bottom, sometimes depicting a bright pattern rarely seen. The small shapes of shell on top of the turtle is known as scutes: nuchal scutes, vertebral scutes, coastal scutes, and marginal scutes. The turtle will shed these as they grow, but doesnâ€™t take much notice to them (the same way a tree sheds a leaves in the winter).

From the external anatomy of the shell we could begin an analysis of the innards of the reptile, but there are other features to note. A turtle comes prepackaged with four limbs, which I refer to as hands for the front two limbs and feet for the back two limbs. I had a turtle once that only had one hand. Tripod is a Western Paint Turtle, iconic for the red plastron. Anoter turtle I have is Squirt, a Red Eared Slider.
