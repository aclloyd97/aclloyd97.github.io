What is an _introvert_? Simply put, an introvert prefer their inner thoughts rather than the outer world's ideas-(to learn if you are an introvert or extrovert, take the [Myer Briggs Test](https://www.16personalities.com/)). I identify as an introvert. However, I would not categorize myself as shy or reclusive. I can talk someone's ear off, I can dance the night away, I can give presentations in front of hundreds of people--playing the part of extrovert is easy for me. However, these things are draining to me, causing me to feel tired faster than usual. Misconceptions about introverts lead to gross and slanderous myths about us. In this post I hope to dispel some of these popular beliefs.

## Signs of Introverts
Taken from [the Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stories-introverts-will-understand_us_56fc1ed3e4b083f5c606759e), I found an interesting article summarizing about "introvert signs." This section of my post is their list with my take.

#### 1. You find small talk incredibly cumbersome.
I find it really hard to have meaningful small talk with a person. But it that the point of small talk, that it is not meaningful? I usually prefer sitting quietly, observing how people do things and their interactions. But why create conversation that neither one of you will remember? I do not see a point to talk just for the sake of talking.

#### 1. You go to parties - but not to meet people.
Usually, I go to parties to make an appearance, as if to confirm that I indeed still exist.

#### 1. You often feel alone in a crowd.
#### 1. Networking makes you feel like a phony.
#### 1. You've been called "too intense."
#### 1. You're easily distracted.
#### 1. Downtime doesn't feel unproductive to you.
#### 1. Giving a talk in front of 500 people is less stressful than having to mingle afterwards.
#### 1. When you get on the subway, you sit at the end of the bench-not in the middle.
#### 1. You start to shut down after you've been active for too long.
#### 1. You're in a relationship with an extrovert.
#### 1. You'd rather be an expert at one thing than try to do everything.
#### 1. You actively avoid any shows that might involve audience participation.
#### 1. You screen all your calls-even from friends.
#### 1. You notice details that others don't.
#### 1. You have a constantly running inner monologue.
#### 1. You have low blood pressure.
