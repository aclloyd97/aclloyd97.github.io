What is an _introvert_? Simply put, an introvert prefer their inner thoughts rather than the outer world's ideas-(to learn if you are an introvert or extrovert, take the [Myer Briggs Test](https://www.16personalities.com/)). I identify as an introvert. However, I would not categorize myself as shy or reclusive. I can talk someone's ear off, I can dance the night away, I can give presentations in front of hundreds of people--playing the part of extrovert is easy for me. However, these things are draining to me, causing me to feel tired faster than usual. Misconceptions about introverts lead to gross and slanderous myths about us. In this post I hope to dispel some of these popular beliefs.
